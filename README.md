A Go version of a game a used to play growing up.

It's a Google Translate version of the telephone game. The program takes an
English phrase and translates it to a random language. It then repeatedly
translates the resulting phrase into other languages, accumulating translation
errors. Finally it translates back to English and displays the result.
